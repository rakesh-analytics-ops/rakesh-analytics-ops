# 💫 About Me:
I am a Data Analyst transitioning from a professional 3D/CGI background, 
with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Machine Learning.

My 3D/CGI experience has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving,
structured thinking, and working with complex data pipelines.
I now apply the same discipline to data analytics and ML projects.

I enjoy working with real-world datasets, performing EDA, building dashboards,
and developing predictive models that support data-driven decision-making.

Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Machine Learning, statistics, and AI
through real-world projects and my Data Science & AI program at upGrad.
I am actively looking for opportunities to grow as a Data Analyst
and collaborate on impactful analytics projects.
