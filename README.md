# 💫 About Me:
I am a Data Analyst transitioning from a professional 3D/CG background, with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning.

My experience in CG production has given me strong problem-solving skills and an understanding of complex, real-world pipelines, which I now apply to analytics and ML projects.

I enjoy working with real datasets, building dashboards, performing EDA, and deploying analytics solutions as live applications.
